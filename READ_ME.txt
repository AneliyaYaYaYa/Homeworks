Hi There,

this is my Homework for WebDriver - part 1.

I have two main test in two different packages:
1. bingsearchtests
2. googlesearchtests

I also have package Enum that contains enum file DriverType. 
You can select different driver type from each tests.
I have worked with Edge, Chrome, Firefox and their headless versions (6 browsers at all).

I have used different techniques in both tests: 
- used both implicit and explicit wait to practise them.
- used both navigate().to() and get() for the url's.
- used click() for search button - click and KEYS.Enter for keyboard press - Enter.

I have added additional searches (search by different term) to see how the system will act with more than one tests.

Hope it worked!
Enjoy :)
