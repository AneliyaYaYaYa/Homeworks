Hi There,

so I worked on the first file Niki uploaded, 
not the updated one. I have create a list methods though.
Just did not have time to change everything.

Some weird thing with my trello - I do not have automatically created lists. Not ever.
So I create my own. Hopefully it will work on your account as well.

To save you the time - my tests run individualy, not altogether.
I have 100% success rate only with the debug mode.

The drag_and_drop_card movement works whenever he pleases, couldn't help it.

So pretty much this is one almost working project. Sorry for the trouble.

Cheers,
Aneliya
