## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the home assignments I've been doing for the last 2 months of my learning path in the Telrik Academy. They are not perfect and most of them need some more work to be done, but they are here to show my progress through the months. Link to my final project in collaboration with two of my colleagues: https://github.com/Alpha-50-group-4-final-project/Group-4-common-repo

## WebDriverHomeworkProject-Search tests
That is my very first experience with the Selenium WebDriver. My task here was to test google and bing search using different browsers (I choose to testsboth chromium and not-chromium based browsers); to practise implicit and explicit waits and play around with Selenium WebDriver.
