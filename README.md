## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the Web testing home assignments I've been doing for the last 2 months of my learning path in the Telrik Academy. They are not perfect and most of them need some more work to be done, but they are here to show my progress through the months.

## WebDriverHomeworkProject-Search tests
That is my very first interaction with the Selenium WebDriver. My task here was to test google and bing search using different browsers (I choose to test both chromium and not-chromium based browsers); to practise implicit and explicit waits and play around with Selenium WebDriver. More information in the respectful README file within the project itself.

## SauceDemoTest
Second interaction with Selenoum WebDriver. The task here was to test end-to-end scenario for an e-commerce site: https://www.saucedemo.com/. I've played a bit with @ParameterizedTest in ProductTest class (see comments). More information in the respectful README file within the project itself.

## SauceDemoTestsWithPageObjects
Taking automation on another level - adding POM to hide implementation details, reduce duplication of code and get more readable tests. Getting better structure for the project itself by grouping classes in different packages.

## RESTAssuredTrelloTests
API testing Trello using REST assured. This porject was part of a Web services exam and tests were created within 2-hour window. A sceleton provided by Telerik Academy was provided for the testingproject.
