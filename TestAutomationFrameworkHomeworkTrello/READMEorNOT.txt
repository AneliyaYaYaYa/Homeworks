Hi There,

so I worked on the first file Niki uploaded, 
not the updated one. I have create a list methods though.
Just did not have time to change everything.

To save you the time - my tests run individualy, not altogether.
And not always :D 100% success rate with the debug though, so I am guessing some wits somewhere had to be amended.
There is some issue with the openBoard method that I was not able to determine - 
no time. Sometimes it opens the board, sometimes - not.
The draganddrop card movement works whenever he pleases, couldn't help it.

So pretty much this is one almost working project. Sorry for the trouble.

Cheers,
Aneliya
