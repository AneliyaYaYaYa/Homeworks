Hi There,

so I worked on the first file Niki uploaded, 
not the one with the list and templates. Just did not have time to change everything.

To save you the time - my tests run individualy, not altogether.
They all run if there is no boards created on the profile - 
wanted to add a method to delete all boards beforehand, but had no time.
There is some issue with the openBoard method that I was not able to determine - 
no time. Sometimes it opens the board, sometimes not.
The draganddrop card movement works whenever he pleases, couldn't help it.

So pretty much this is on almost working project. Sorry for the trouble.

Cheers,
Aneliya
